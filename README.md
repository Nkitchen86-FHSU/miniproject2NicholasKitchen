# Project Title
 
Mini Project 2 Highest GDP Growth
 
## Description
 
This program will answer the two questions, "Which country had the highest increase in GDP from 2020 to 2025? What were the top 5?" Using a dataset from Kaggle.com, this program will find the top 5 countries who saw the largest GDP growth and create two graphs. One will show the GDP growth top 5 countries from 2020 to 2025. The second will show the overall change in GDP from 2020 to 2025 for each of the top 5 countries. The program will also print the answer to the two questions.
